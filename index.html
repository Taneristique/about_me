                I was like a photographer in the past and doing so much drawing by the way.I remember that 
                I took so much photo until 2019.In 2019,I started Ynov Campus and live the last memories in France but these were the most important ones we got an education from
                html to connected objects and until "node.js".I put one of my cvs.But if you want to go carousel section <a href="carousel.html" target='_blank'> touch here. </a>
